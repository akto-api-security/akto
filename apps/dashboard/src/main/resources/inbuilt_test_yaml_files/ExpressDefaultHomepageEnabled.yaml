  name: Express Default Homepage Enabled 
  description:  Express Default Homepage Enabled Misconfiguration
  details: >
      The Express Default Homepage Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the default homepage is enabled in a production 
      environment. The default homepage typically displays a welcome message and may reveal information about the Express 
      framework being used. This can provide valuable insights to potential attackers, helping them identify vulnerabilities 
      or weaknesses in the system. To reduce the risk of exposing sensitive details and to enhance security, it is recommended
      to disable or customize the default homepage in production environments.
  impact: Enabling the Express default homepage exposes information about the framework, increasing the risk of targeted attacks and potential exploitation.
