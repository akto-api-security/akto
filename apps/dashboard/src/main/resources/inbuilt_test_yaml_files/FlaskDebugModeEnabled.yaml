  description: Flask Debug Mode Enabled Misconfiguration.
  details: >
         The Flask Debug Mode Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the debug mode is enabled in a Flask
          application. Debug mode is a development feature that provides detailed error messages, 
          interactive consoles, and other debugging capabilities. However, enabling debug mode in a 
          production environment can expose sensitive information and introduce security risks. 
          Attackers can exploit debug mode to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or 
          obtain sensitive configuration details. This misconfiguration has a low severity level and 
          falls under the Security Misconfiguration category.
  impact: Enabling Flask debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive information and introduces security vulnerabilities to potential unauthorized access and code execution.
