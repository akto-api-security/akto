  description: Rails Default Homepage Enabled Misconfiguration.
  details: >
       The Rails Default Homepage Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the default homepage of a Rails 
       application is accessible in a production environment. This misconfiguration reveals sensitive 
       information such as the Rails version and can potentially provide attackers with valuable 
       insights into the application's technology stack. It is recommended to customize the default
        homepage or restrict its access to prevent information leakage and mitigate the risk of 
        targeted attacks. This misconfiguration has a low severity level and falls under the Security 
        Misconfiguration category.
  impact: Allowing access to the default Rails homepage exposes sensitive information about the application, aiding potential attackers in understanding its technology stack and vulnerabilities.
