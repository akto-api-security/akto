  name: Spring Boot Environment Actuator Exposed 
  description: Spring Boot Environment Actuator Exposed Misconfiguration.
  details: >
       The Spring Boot Environment Actuator Exposed misconfiguration occurs when the Actuator endpoint, 
       which provides access to application environment details, is accessible to unauthorized users. 
       This misconfiguration can lead to security risks as sensitive environment information, such as 
       configuration properties and active profiles, can be exposed. Attackers can gain insights into 
       the application's inner workings and exploit vulnerabilities. It falls under the Security Misconfiguration
       category with a low severity level. Proper access control and secure configuration of the Actuator 
       endpoints are crucial to protect sensitive environment details.
  impact: Exposing Spring Boot Environment Actuator can expose sensitive environment information, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
