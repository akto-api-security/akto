  name: Access Control Bypass by changing request method to an arbitrary value
  description: "Many authentication mechanisms only limit access to the most common HTTP methods, thus allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources by other HTTP methods."
  details: >
            "It may be possible to bypass authentication or authorization on this endpoint by changing the HTTP
            method to an arbitrary value. The original request was replayed by removing victim's <b>auth</b> token. The server 
            responded with 2XX success codes.<br>"
            "<b>Background:</b> An access control vulnerability can arise if the server does not properly enforce 
            authorization checks for certain resources when the an arbitrary method value is used. This vulnerability can allow 
            an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to restricted resources. The access 
            bypass control by changing the HTTP method to an arbitrary value occurs when an attacker modifies the HTTP request 
            method from a restricted method (e.g., POST) to the an arbitrary value. By doing so, the attacker aims to 
            exploit the server's vulnerability in handling authorization checks for the given method, which may 
            differ from other methods."
  impact: "Broken User authentication is a serious vulnerability. Attackers can gain control to other user's 
          accounts in the system, read their personal data, and perform sensitive actions on their behalf, like 
          money transactions and sending personal messages."
