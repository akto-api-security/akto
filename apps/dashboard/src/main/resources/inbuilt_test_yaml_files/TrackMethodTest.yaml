  name: TRACK Method Vulnerability Test
  description: "The endpoint appears to accept requests with TRACK HTTP Method. The original request was replayed by replacing the method value with TRACK. The application responded with 2XX success code."
  details: >
            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to unsafe HTTP methods attack. The original request was 
            replayed by replacing the method value with TRACK. The server responded with 2XX success code.
            "<b>Background:</b> The TRACK method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of 
            the request message. TRACK allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of the 
            request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information.
  impact: "TRACK method can be used for debugging purposes. It repeats the content of a request, and an attacker could steal credentials by using a client-side attack."
