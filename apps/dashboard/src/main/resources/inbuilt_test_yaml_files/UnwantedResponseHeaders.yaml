  description: "The response contains headers which might leak sensitive information."
  details: >
            "Some headers contain data pertaining to server information like server version or details about 
            hosting and deployment. This data makes your site easier to attack. Some other headers can also be 
            used to override the default behaviour of the application and give debug information or skip 
            authentication."
  impact: "This information can be used to facilitate more sophisticated attacks on your application."
