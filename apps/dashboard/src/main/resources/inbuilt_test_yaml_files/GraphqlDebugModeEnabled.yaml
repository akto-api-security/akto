  description: "GraphQL debug mode enabled vulnerability exposes sensitive debug information, increasing the risk of data leakage and potential security breaches"
  details: > 
            GraphQL debug mode enabled vulnerability refers to a security risk that arises when the 
            debug mode in GraphQL is left enabled in production environments. Debug mode is intended 
            for development and debugging purposes, providing detailed error messages and stack traces 
            to aid in troubleshooting. However, when enabled in a live production system, it can expose 
            sensitive information to potential attackers. The detailed error messages may inadvertently 
            disclose implementation details, internal system paths, or sensitive data, increasing the risk 
            of data leakage and potential security breaches. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial 
            to disable debug mode in production environments and ensure that only essential error messages 
            are exposed to clients. Regular security audits and secure coding practices should be employed to protect sensitive information.
