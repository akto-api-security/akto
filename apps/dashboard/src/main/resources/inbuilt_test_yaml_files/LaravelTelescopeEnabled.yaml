  description: Laravel Telescope Enabled Misconfiguration.
  details: >
        Laravel Telescope makes a wonderful companion to your local Laravel development environment. Telescope provides 
        insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, 
        notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps, and more. The Laravel Telescope Enabled 
        misconfiguration occurs when the Laravel Telescope debugging tool is accessible in a production environment. Telescope
        provides extensive insights into the application's requests, commands, and schedule,  which can be useful during 
        development but pose a security risk when exposed in a live environment. This misconfiguration reveals sensitive 
        information about the application's internal workings and can aid potential attackers in understanding its structure 
        and vulnerabilities. It is recommended to disable or restrict access to Laravel Telescope in production to mitigate the risk of information leakage.
  impact: Allowing access to Laravel Telescope exposes sensitive internal information about the application, aiding potential attackers in understanding its structure and vulnerabilities.
