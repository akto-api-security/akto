  description: Spring Boot Thread Dump Actuator Exposed Misconfiguration
  details: >
        The Spring Boot Thread Dump Actuator Exposed misconfiguration occurs when the Actuator endpoint
        responsible for providing thread dump information is accessible to unauthorized users. This 
        misconfiguration can lead to security risks as sensitive information about running threads, 
        including thread names, stack traces, and thread states, can be exposed. Attackers can 
        potentially use this information to gather insights into the application's execution environment
        and exploit vulnerabilities. It falls under the Security Misconfiguration category with a low 
        severity level. Proper access control and secure configuration of the Actuator endpoints are
        necessary to prevent unauthorized access to thread dump information.
  impact: Exposing Spring Boot Thread Dump Actuator can disclose sensitive information about running threads, aiding attackers in understanding the application's execution environment.
