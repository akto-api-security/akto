  description: Attacker can change the data type to cause unintended behaviors or unhandled edge cases
  details: >
    Parameters in a different data type than found/expected were send in
    the attack request and the server responded with 2XX [valid request] or 500
    [Internal server error] response.The 2XX response in an invalid request
    signifies that the server accepts the request in an unexpected format, such
    as an array, null values or values in a different data type (integer to
    string). An attacker can exploit this behavior by sending multiple values,
    including the attacker's values, which may then be processed by the server.
    The 500 response suggests that the server had not expected these values and
    has encountered an unhandled error. This is significant since these requests
    may lead to a possible DOS or unexpected downtime since they essentially
    break the server and force it to restart. Ideally, in such a scenario, the
    server should respond with a 4XX error code. This signifies that the server
    handles the unexpected types gracefully. <br><br>
  impact: Server accepting invalid types may lead the hacker to pass their own
    values leading to parameter pollution type of attack and the server not
    handling invalid types may lead it to break thus resulting in possible DOS.
