  name: Django Default Homepage Enabled 
  description: Detection of Django default homepage enabled misconfiguration, exposing sensitive information and indicating a potential security risk.
  details: >
       The Django Default Homepage Enabled test identifies a security misconfiguration where the default homepage
       of a Django application is accessible. The test checks if the response payload contains the string "The 
       install worked successfully! Congratulations!" which indicates that the default homepage is enabled. Having
       the default homepage accessible can expose sensitive information about the Django application, such as 
       version numbers and potentially sensitive file paths. This misconfiguration falls under the Security 
       Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Disabling the default homepage in production
        environments is crucial to minimize information exposure and enhance security
  impact: Enabling the Django default homepage exposes sensitive information, indicating potential security risks and facilitating targeted attacks on known vulnerabilities.
