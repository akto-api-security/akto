id: COMMAND_INJECTION_BY_ADDING_QUERY_PARAM
info:
  name: "Command injection by adding query parameters"
  description: "This test explores various query parameter names for potential command injection, such as cmd, exec, command, execute, ping, and query."
  details: >
    "This test aims to identify command injection vulnerabilities by adding query parameters that resemble common command execution keywords.
    For example, parameters like "cmd," "exec," or "command" may be susceptible. If the application fails to properly sanitize or validate these inputs, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands.
    Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized command execution, data manipulation, and potential system compromise."
  impact: "Command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, system compromise, and potential disruption of services, making it a severe security risk."
