info:
  name: "JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection"
  description: "Since Host server is using the JKU field of the JWT without validating, attacker can tamper with the payload of JWT and access protected resources."
  details: >
            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to broken authentication attack.The original request was replayed by adding the JKU parameter value to the header of
            JWT and signing with Akto's key. The server responded with 2XX success codes. This indicates that this endpoint can be accessed with a tampered JWT.<br>"
            "<b>Background:</b> The JSON Web Signature specification defines the optional \"jku\" header, which contains a URL pointing to a set of keys used by the server to digitally sign
            the JWT. This parameter is particularly useful for servers that are configured to use multiple different keys because it can help to determine which key to use when verifying the
            signature. If the target application implicitly trusts this header, it may verify the signature using an arbitrary public key obtained from the provided URL, essentially relying
            on data that can be tampered with client-side. A malicious user could insert or modify a \"jku\" header so that it points to an external server containing a JSON Web Key Set that
            they've generated themselves. They could then re-sign the token using the matching private key and check whether the server still accepts it."
  impact: > 
            "Using this vulnerability an attacker can do a full account takeover. <br><br>"
            "They can also exploit this vulnerability by supplying an arbitrary claim in the JWT payload to escalate their privileges or impersonate other users. For example,
            if the token contains a \"username\": \"joe\" claim, they could change this to \"username\": \"admin\"."
