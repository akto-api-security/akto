  description: Spring Boot Beans Actuator Exposed Misconfiguration.
  details: >
       The Spring Boot Beans Actuator Exposed misconfiguration occurs when the Actuator endpoint, which provides 
       information about application beans, is accessible to unauthorized users. This misconfiguration can lead to 
       potential security risks as sensitive information, such as bean details, dependencies, and scopes, can be 
       exposed. It falls under the Security Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Proper access 
       control and secure configuration of the Actuator endpoints are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and 
       protect sensitive information.
  impact: Exposing Spring Boot Beans Actuator can lead to unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive application information.
