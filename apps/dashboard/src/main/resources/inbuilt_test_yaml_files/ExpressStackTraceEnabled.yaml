info:
  name: Express Stack Trace Enabled 
  description:  Express Stack Trace Enabled Misconfiguration exposes sensitive error details, potentially aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting the application.
  details: >
          The Express Stack Trace Enabled misconfiguration occurs when detailed error stack traces are returned in response 
          payloads. These stack traces contain sensitive information about the application's code, such as file paths and 
          function names. If an attacker gains access to these stack traces, it can significantly aid them in identifying 
          potential vulnerabilities and crafting targeted attacks. It is crucial to disable stack trace information in 
          production environments to prevent the exposure of sensitive details and enhance security posture.
  impact:  Enabling stack traces in Express responses exposes sensitive code information, assisting attackers in pinpointing vulnerabilities and launching targeted attacks.
