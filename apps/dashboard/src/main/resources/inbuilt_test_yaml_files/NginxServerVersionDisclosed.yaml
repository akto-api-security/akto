  name: Nginx Server Version Disclosed 
  description: Detection of Nginx server version disclosure misconfiguration, potentially aiding attackers in identifying vulnerable versions.
  details: >
       The Nginx Server Version Disclosed test identifies a security misconfiguration where the Nginx server 
       version is disclosed in the response headers. The test checks if the response headers contain a version 
       string matching the regular expression "nginx/[0-9.]+". Disclosing the server version can aid attackers in 
       identifying potentially vulnerable versions and targeting specific exploits. This misconfiguration falls 
       under the Security Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Concealing the server version in the
       response headers enhances security by reducing the exposure of potentially sensitive information.
  impact: Disclosing Nginx server version exposes potentially vulnerable versions, aiding attackers in identifying exploits and targeting specific vulnerabilities.
