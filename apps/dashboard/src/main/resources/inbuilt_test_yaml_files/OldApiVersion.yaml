  name: BOLA in old api versions
  description: "Attacker can access resources of any user by changing the auth token in request and using older version of an API"
  details: >   
            "Unpatched old api versions were found for this endpoint. The original request was replayed by changing the version of the endpoint
            (For example: the request url was changed from <b>www.example.com/dfsh/v5/fd</b> to <b>www.example.com/dfsh/v1/fd</b>). The server responded with 2XX success codes.<br><br>"
            "The old API versions found appears to be vulnerable to broken object level authorization attack. The original
            request was replayed with attacker's auth token. The server responded with 2XX success codes and greater than <b>{{percentageMatch}}%</b> of the response body matched with original
            response body. Also, the endpoint had atleast one private resources in request payload.<br><br>"
            "<b>Background:</b> Old API versions are usually unpatched and are vulnerable to attacks such as BOLA. Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually
            implemented at the code level to validate that one user can only access objects that they should have access to."
  impact: "Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover."
