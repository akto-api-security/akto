  name: Invalid File Input Leaking Sensitive Details Via Verbose Error Message
  description: "The error response contains information which may help in more sophisticated attacks"
  details: >
          "The error response contains information about the database or an inconsistent error message.<br>"
          "<b>Background:</b> Inconsistencies in error messages can reveal important clues on how a site works, 
          and what information is present under the covers. For example, when a user tries to access a file that 
          does not exist, the error message typically indicates, “file not found”. When accessing a file that 
          the user is not authorized for, it indicates, “access denied”. The user is not supposed to know the 
          file even exists, but such inconsistencies will readily reveal the presence or absence of inaccessible 
          files or the site directory structure. It may also contain informaiton pertaining to which database is being used."	
  impact: "This information can be used to facilitate more sophisticated attacks on your application"
