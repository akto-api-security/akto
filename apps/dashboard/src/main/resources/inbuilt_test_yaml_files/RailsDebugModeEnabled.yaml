  description: "Rails debug mode enabled misconfiguration can expose sensitive information, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities."
  details: >
          The Rails Debug Mode Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the Ruby on Rails framework is 
          configured to run in debug mode, allowing detailed error information to be displayed in 
          responses. This can expose sensitive information, such as full file paths, database details, 
          and stack traces, to potential attackers. By analyzing the debug output, attackers can gain 
          insights into the application's internals and potentially exploit vulnerabilities. This 
          misconfiguration falls under the Security Misconfiguration category and has a low severity 
          level. Disabling debug mode in production environments is essential to prevent information 
          disclosure and enhance the application's security posture.
  impact: "Enabling Rails debug mode can expose sensitive information, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities and potential attacks."
