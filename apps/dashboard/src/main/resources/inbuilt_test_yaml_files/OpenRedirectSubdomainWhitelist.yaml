id: OPEN_REDIRECT_SUBDOMAIN_WHITELIST
info:
  name: "Open redirect subdomain whitelist"
  description: "An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain by leveraging subdomain whitelisting."
  details: > 
            "Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way.
            The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility 
            to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain"
  impact: "This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application."
