  name: Struts OGNL Console Enabled 
  description: "Detection of Struts OGNL console enabled misconfiguration, which can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities."
  details: >
          The Struts OGNL Console Enabled test identifies a security misconfiguration where the OGNL 
          (Object-Graph Navigation Language) console in Struts framework is accessible. By modifying the URL and 
          appending "struts/webconsole.html?debug=console," the test checks if the OGNL console is enabled and 
          accessible. Enabling the OGNL console can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities, allowing 
          attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This misconfiguration falls under the Security 
          Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Disabling the OGNL console is essential to prevent 
          potential remote code execution and enhance application security.
  impact: "Enabling Struts OGNL console exposes the application to remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server."
